## **Welcome to my homepage!**

My name is Qi-Te Yang. I received my Master's degree from Xiangtan University in 2020 (supervisor: Prof. Juan Zou (邹娟)), and received my Ph.D. degree from South China University of Technology in 2024 (supervisor: Prof. [Zhi-Hui Zhan](https://zhanapollo.github.io/zhanzhh/) (詹志辉)). My research interests in evolutionary computation, multiobjective optimization, surrogate-assisted optimization, and feature selection
