Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Qi-Te Yang. I received my master's degree from Xiangtan University in 2020 (supervisor: Prof. Juan Zou), and received my Ph.D. degree from South China University of Technology in 2024 (supervisor: Prof. [Zhi-Hui Zhan](https://zhanapollo.github.io/zhanzhh/)). My research interests in evolutionary computation, multiobjective optimization, surrogate-assisted optimization, and feature selection
